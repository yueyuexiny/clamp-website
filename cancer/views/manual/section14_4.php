        <strong> To assign relation:</strong>
        By dragging your mouse from an independent entity and dropping it to a
        dependent entity, the names of possible relations will occur. Choose the appropriate
        relation name by clicking on one of the displayed names.

            <figcaption> Relation annotation</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <p>
        Please remember that you can only assign a relation to the entities that have already been
        defined in that relation.
