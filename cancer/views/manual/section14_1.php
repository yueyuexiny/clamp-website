    <p>
        The CLAMP-Cancer annotation module enables you to annotate customized entities and specify
        relations between them in your desired corpus . These annotations enable you to assign
        additional clinical information to a selected text and develop an annotated corpus thatâ€™s
        more suitable to the specific task that you have. Task-specific models can be developed
        and used in the machine-learning modules of CLAMP-Cancer or any other system of your choice.
        <span class="subtitles-manual"> Before using this function, you need to:</span>

    <ol class="manual-numbers">
        <li>
            Create a project

        <li>
            Import the files that you want to annotate
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        After completing these steps, you will be able to annotate the imported files based on some
        predefined structure. The following steps will guide you on how to perform the steps
        mentioned above.

            from the annotated files.In
            addition, the prediction results generated from
            the n-fold cross-validation process and gold
            standard annotations are included in this folder.
