    <p>
        To configure a pipeline double click on the .pipeline file from the newly created pipeline
        project to open it in the middle window on the screen.
        Here you can drag and drop the NLP components from the Component panel. Since we
        want to recognize clinical concepts using NLP components, we drag the
        DF_CRF_based_name_entity_recognizer from the NLP_components to the pipeline.
