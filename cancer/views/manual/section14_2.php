                    Click on the Browse button on the top of the window to choose the folder of your
                    choice. The selected folder will be displayed on the left side of the window,
                    and the
                    content of the folder will be displayed on the right side. To import you desired
                    files,
                    check the checkboxes next to the files of your choice.
                    <p>
                        You also have three options to choose from:
                        <br>
                        <strong>Filter Types/ Select All/ Deselect All</strong>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Filter Types:</strong> Allows you to define the type of files that
                        will be imported. The only
                        extensions that you will work with in CLAMP-Cancer are txt, and .xmi. For example,
                        you may only
                        want to import files with the .txt extension
                        <strong>Select All: </strong>Allows you to choose all displayed files
                        <strong>Deselect All:</strong> Allow you to deselect the files that have
                        already been selected
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on the Browse button next to the "Into folder" field to choose the folder
                    that you
                    want to import your files to. Here, we keep the default directory
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on the Finish button.

        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Now that the selected files have been imported to your desired folder, you can start
        annotating them. Double click on the files to open theim in the middle window and annotate
        them. Upon double clicking each file, you will notice that another file with the same name
        but a different extension (.xmi) has been added to your folder and displayed on the screen.
        This is the file type used by CLAMP-Cancer for display and interaction purposes.
