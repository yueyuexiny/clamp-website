    <p>
        A UMLS Encoder matches the terms of clinical concepts to its corresponding CUIs in
        UMLS. For example, the term "breast cancer" will be encoded into the CUI of "C6006142" in
        UMLS. Currently CLAMP-Cancer provides a default dictionary based on the UMLS encoder as
        shown in figure below</p>
