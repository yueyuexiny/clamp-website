        <h4>NLP Components
        </h4>
        <p> NLP components are used for processing text. CLAMP-Cancer offers multiple NLP components
            that are the building blocks for performing any of the NLP tasks. The individual
            components are provided as pre-built modules that are to be used in building pipelines for
            automatic text processing, as well as training customized machine learning models. The
            following picture
            displays the CLAMP-Cancer NLP components, as well as its associated tools, algorithms and
            resources. In this section, we will provide details about each NLP component including their
            function as well as ways to customize them using your own dictionary/model. In "Build a
            Pipeline" section, we have tutorials that touch on use cases wherein the components are
            utilized in various applications.</p>
