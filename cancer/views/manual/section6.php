        <p><strong>On Windows</strong>, simply copy contents of your previous work folder (i.e. from
            older
            Clamp_x.xx.xx_win\workspace\MyPipeline\ contents to new
            Clamp_x.xx.xx_win\workspace\MyPipeline\ contents) using <strong>Windows Explorer </strong>and
            <strong>restart CLAMP-Cancer</strong> if it’s already running. On startup, CLAMP-Cancer will recognize
            these projects and
            import them into your workspace.
        </p>
        <p><strong>On MacOSX</strong>, similarly copy contents of your previous work folder (i.e. from

            Clamp_x.xx.xx_win/workspace/MyPipeline/ contents to new
            Clamp_x.xx.xx_win/workspace/MyPipeline/ contents) using <strong>Finder </strong>and <strong>
                restart CLAMP-Cancer</strong>
            if it’s already running. On startup, CLAMP-Cancer will recognize these projects and import them
            into your new workspace.
