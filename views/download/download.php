Faculty at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (University) have developed certain Software and Documentation that University wishes  to make available for non-commercial academic, research, experimental or personal use only. This license is designed to provide permission to use the software for these limited purposes. Distribution or any use other than as described above, including any commercial use, requires a separate license from University.

1.7 Third Party Software means any third party code software or open source code software or any components incorporated in, used in the creation of, or used in conjunction with Software which may include restrictions or requirements on its use under a third party license. Such third party licenses may include any software licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses, including without limitation any license that, as a condition of distribution of the software licensed under such license, requires that the distributor make the software available in source code format.
2.  GRANT OF RIGHTS.

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
